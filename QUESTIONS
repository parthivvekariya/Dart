10.    What is a lambda function?  
    A lambda function, also known as an anonymous function or a closure, is a function that's defined without a name. In Dart, you can define lambda functions using the => syntax.

11.    What is class and object?  
    A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of objects. An object is an instance of a class.

12.    What is inheritance?  
    Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

13.    What is the meaning of getter and setter?  
    Getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the properties of an object, respectively. They provide control over how properties are accessed and modified.

14.    What is method overriding in Dart?  
    Method overriding is a feature of object-oriented programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows for polymorphic behavior.

15.    What is a constructor?  
    A constructor is a special method used for initializing objects. It's called automatically when an object is created. In Dart, constructors can be named or unnamed.

16.    Difference between final and const in Dart programming   
    In Dart, final variables can only be set once and their value can be set at runtime, while const variables are compile-time constants and their value must be known at compile time.

17.    Which operating systems does Dart language support?  
    Dart is supported on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

18.    What does the AppBar widget in Flutter contain?

19.    What is a Scaffold widget?  
    The Scaffold widget in Flutter provides a basic layout structure for the app. It typically contains an app bar, body, floating action button, and more.

20.    Difference between stateless widgets and stateful widgets?  
    Stateless widgets are immutable and their state cannot change during the runtime of the app, while stateful widgets can maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget.

21.    How can you initialize the final instance variable in Dart language?  
    Final instance variables in Dart can be initialized either in the constructor or at the point of declaration.

22.    What is a horizontal bar mainly displayed at the top of the Scaffold widget in Flutter?  
    The horizontal bar displayed at the top of the Scaffold widget in Flutter is typically the AppBar widget.

23.    What displays the main content in the Scaffold widget in Flutter?  
    The main content in the Scaffold widget in Flutter is typically displayed within the body property.

24.    What is a slider panel that is displayed at the side in Flutter?  
    The slider panel that is displayed at the side in Flutter is typically the Drawer widget.

25.    Difference between Flutter and React Native?  
    Flutter and React Native are both popular frameworks for building cross-platform mobile applications. Flutter uses Dart programming language and provides a rich set of customizable UI widgets, while React Native uses JavaScript and relies on native components.

26.    Advantages of Flutter?  
    Advantages of Flutter include hot reload for rapid development, single codebase for multiple platforms, expressive and flexible UI components, high performance, and strong community support.

27.    Difference between runApp() and main() in Flutter?  
    runApp() is a function in Flutter used to run the root widget of the application, while main() is the entry point of the Dart program where execution begins.

28.    Explain packages and plugins in Flutter.  
    Packages in Flutter are reusable libraries of Dart code that provide functionality to Flutter apps. Plugins are specialized packages that allow Flutter apps to interact with native platform features and third-party services.

29.    What do you mean by keys in Flutter? When should one use it?  
    Keys in Flutter are used to uniquely identify widgets. They are useful when working with lists, animations, or when needing to maintain the state of widgets across rebuilds.

30.    Explain the Container class in Flutter.  
    The Container class in Flutter is a widget used to create a rectangular visual element. It can be styled using various properties such as color, padding, margin, alignment, and more.

31.    Which one is better, Flutter or React Native?

37.    How can we create HTTP requests in Flutter?  
    HTTP requests in Flutter can be created using the http package, which provides functions for making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of requests.

38.    Explain Flutter Provider.  
    Flutter Provider is a state management solution that allows widgets to access and share data without needing to pass it explicitly down the widget tree. It provides a way to manage application state efficiently.

39.    Difference between SizedBox Vs Container.  
    SizedBox is a widget used to create a fixed-size box, while Container is a more versatile widget that can contain child widgets and provides properties for styling and layout.

40.    What do you mean by Null-aware operators?  
    Null-aware operators are special operators in Dart that help in handling null values more efficiently. Examples include the null-aware assignment operator (??=) and the null-aware access operator (?.).

41.    How to access screen size in Flutter?  
    You can access the screen size in Flutter using the MediaQuery class, which provides information about the size and orientation of the device screen.

42.    What is setState?  
    setState is a method used in Flutter to update the state of a StatefulWidget. It triggers a rebuild of the widget subtree, allowing changes to be reflected in the UI.

43.    What is the difference between Hot Reload and Hot Restart?  
    Hot Reload in Flutter allows you to inject updated code into a running Dart Virtual Machine without restarting the entire application, preserving the application state. Hot Restart, on the other hand, restarts the entire application, including the Dart VM, and resets the application state.
